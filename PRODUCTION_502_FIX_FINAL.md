# Final Solution: 502 Errors on Manual Refresh Only

## Root Cause Identified
The 502 errors occur **ONLY on manual browser refresh** (not during client-side navigation), which means:
- SSR (server-side rendering) is timing out
- Client-side navigation works perfectly
- The infrastructure (reverse proxy/container) has a timeout shorter than SSR processing time

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Production
```bash
DISABLE_AUTH_REFRESH=true
```

### 2. Check Your Hosting Platform Timeouts

Based on your debug endpoint showing Linux/Node v18.20.8, you're likely using:

#### Railway/Render/Fly.io
- Default timeout: 30 seconds
- Check for `timeout` settings in your config

#### Docker/Container Settings
```dockerfile
# If using custom Dockerfile, add:
ENV DISABLE_AUTH_REFRESH=true
```

#### Nginx (if used as reverse proxy)
```nginx
proxy_read_timeout 60s;
proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
proxy_send_timeout 60s;
```

#### Cloudflare
- Free plan: 100 second timeout (shouldn't be the issue)
- Check if you have any Page Rules affecting timeouts

### 3. Platform-Specific Fixes

#### For Railway
Add to `railway.json`:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

#### For Render
Add to `render.yaml`:
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: zaur-app
    env: node
    buildCommand: pnpm install && pnpm run build
    startCommand: node build
    envVars:
      - key: DISABLE_AUTH_REFRESH
        value: true
```

#### For Vercel (if applicable)
Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "src/routes/**/*.js": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```

## Why This Happens

1. **Manual refresh** = Full SSR cycle
2. **Client navigation** = No SSR, just API calls
3. Your SSR takes longer than the platform timeout
4. Platform kills the request = 502 error

## Verification Steps

1. Check platform logs during 502:
   ```
   Look for: "Function execution timeout" or "Request timeout"
   ```

2. Test with curl to measure SSR time:
   ```bash
   time curl -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie" https://zaur.app/tours
   ```

3. If time > 30s, you've found the issue

## Long-term Solution

Consider implementing:
1. Static generation for authenticated pages
2. Edge caching with short TTL
3. Progressive enhancement (load shell, then data)
4. Increase platform timeout limits (if possible)

## Contact Your Hosting Provider

Since the code optimizations are complete, this is now an infrastructure issue. Contact your hosting provider and:
1. Ask about increasing timeout limits
2. Check if there are any proxy layers adding timeouts
3. Request access to timeout error logs

The fact that it works perfectly during client-side navigation proves the app is fine - it's purely an SSR timeout issue at the infrastructure level.
