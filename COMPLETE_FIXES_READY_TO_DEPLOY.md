## 🧪 Test After Deploy

### 1. Test Transfers (Main Issue)
```bash
curl -X GET "https://zaur.app/api/cron/process-transfers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer XQhUXDpERvtclb0eV+Mja2nlFj5ZksdmO9VPr+R3aQw="
```

**Expected:** 11 transfers processed successfully

### 2. Test Booking Page
Open: `https://zaur.app/bookings/[any-booking-id]`

**Should see:**
- ✅ Status dropdown: Pending, Confirmed, Completed, No Show (NO "Cancelled")
- ✅ Help text: "To cancel with refund, use the Cancel Booking section below"
- ✅ RefundPreviewCard: Only way to cancel with refund

### 3. Test No Show Status
- Select "No Show" from dropdown
- Should update successfully (no more "Invalid status" error)

### 4. Test Cancellation
- Use "Cancel Booking" section
- Should show refund calculation
- Should process refund properly

## 📊 What Changed

### Before:
```
❌ Transfers never sent (11 stuck pending)
❌ No refund protection after transfers
❌ Dual cancellation systems (confusing)
❌ "No show" status not supported
❌ VARCHAR status columns (no validation)
```

### After:
```
✅ Transfers work correctly
✅ Smart refunds with transfer reversals
✅ ONE cancellation system (RefundPreviewCard)
✅ "No show" status supported
✅ Enum status columns (validated)
✅ Backward compatible migration
```

## 🔐 Safety

- ✅ Zero breaking changes
- ✅ Old system still works
- ✅ Easy rollback: `node scripts/rollback-migration.js`
- ✅ Monitoring ready: `node scripts/verify-migration.js`

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### Daily (First Week):
```bash
node scripts/verify-migration.js
```

Look for:
- ✅ Columns stay synced
- ✅ Transfers processing
- ✅ No errors

### Weekly:
- Check transfer success rate
- Monitor refund handling
- Verify no data corruption
