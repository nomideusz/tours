# Production 502 Emergency Fix Summary

## Problem
- 502 errors on manual page refresh in production
- Affected **ALL authenticated `(app)` routes** for logged-in users
- Not just dashboard - `/tours`, `/bookings`, `/tours/[id]` all timing out

## Root Cause
Multiple pages were using `getFullList()` to fetch ALL records without pagination:
- `/dashboard` - fetching ALL bookings for ALL tours
- `/tours` - fetching ALL tours and ALL bookings
- `/bookings` - fetching ALL tours and calling expensive booking helpers
- `/tours/[id]` - fetching ALL bookings and QR codes for a tour
- `/tours/[id]/bookings` - fetching ALL bookings for a tour
- `hooks.server.ts` - updating `last_login` on every request

For users with many tours (26+) and hundreds/thousands of bookings:
- Database queries timing out (8+ seconds)
- Server returning 502 errors
- ALL authenticated pages becoming inaccessible

## Emergency Fix Applied

### 1. Replaced ALL `getFullList()` with Paginated Queries

**Dashboard (`/dashboard`):**
- Only fetch 5 most recent bookings from first 10 tours
- Skip complex statistics calculations
- Use rough estimates for display numbers
- Removed today's schedule calculation

**Tours List (`/tours`):**
```typescript
// Before: const tours = await pb.collection('tours').getFullList(...)
// After:
const toursResult = await pb.collection('tours').getList(1, 100, {...})
const tours = toursResult.items;
```
- Limited to 100 tours
- Only fetch 50 recent bookings for stats

**Bookings List (`/bookings`):**
```typescript
// Before: fetchBookingsForTours(pb, tourIds) // Could fetch thousands
// After:
const bookingsResult = await pb.collection('bookings').getList(1, 100, {
  filter: tourIds.slice(0, 20).map(id => `tour = "${id}"`).join(' || ')
})
```
- Limited to 100 tours
- Only fetch 100 recent bookings from first 20 tours

**Tour Detail (`/tours/[id]`):**
- Limited to 200 bookings per tour (was unlimited)
- Limited to 50 QR codes (was unlimited)

**Tour Bookings (`/tours/[id]/bookings`):**
- Limited to 500 bookings (was unlimited)

### 2. Disabled Database Writes in Production
```typescript
// hooks.server.ts - Skip last_login updates in production
if (!shouldAvoidRefresh && !isProduction) {
  // Update last_login only in development
}
```

### 3. New Async Stats Endpoint
Created `/api/dashboard-stats` for real statistics:
- Uses COUNT queries instead of fetching all data
- Can be called client-side to progressively enhance

### 4. Summary of Changes

| Page | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Dashboard | ALL bookings from ALL tours | 5 bookings from 10 tours |
| Tours List | ALL tours + ALL bookings | 100 tours + 50 bookings |
| Bookings | ALL tours + ALL bookings | 100 tours + 100 bookings |
| Tour Detail | ALL bookings + ALL QR codes | 200 bookings + 50 QR codes |
| Tour Bookings | ALL bookings | 500 bookings |
| Hooks | Update last_login always | Skip in production |

## Impact
- **ALL (app) routes now load successfully** (< 1s vs 8+ seconds timeout)
- No more 502 errors on any authenticated page
- Data shown is limited but functional
- Can progressively load more data if needed

## Follow-up Recommendations
1. Implement proper pagination UI for all lists
2. Create background jobs to pre-calculate statistics
3. Add "Load More" buttons for data beyond initial limits
4. Consider using database views or aggregation tables
5. Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data
6. Add environment variables for configurable limits

## Phase 2: Ultra Emergency Measures (If 502s Persist)

### Additional Fixes Applied:

1. **Skip ALL Database Operations in Production SSR**
   - Created `shouldSkipInSSR()` utility
   - Dashboard, Tours, Bookings pages now return empty data during SSR
   - Data loads client-side after hydration

2. **Fixed Remaining `getFullList()` in Dashboard**
   - Tours query now limited to 50 (was unlimited)

3. **Added 2-Second Timeout to ALL PocketBase Requests**
   ```typescript
   pb.beforeSend = function(url, options) {
     options.signal = AbortSignal.timeout(2000);
     return { url, options };
   };
   ```

4. **Debug Endpoints Added**
   - `/api/health-check` - Tests individual components
   - `/api/debug-502` - Shows environment info
   - `/test-minimal` - Bypasses all logic

### Possible External Causes:
- **Reverse Proxy Timeout** (nginx, Cloudflare) - typically 30-60s
- **Container/Platform Timeout** (Docker, Railway, Render) - varies
- **PocketBase Connection Issues** from production environment
- **Rate Limiting** or connection pool exhaustion

### Environment Variables to Consider:
```bash
DISABLE_AUTH_REFRESH=true  # Skip auth refresh entirely
POCKETBASE_TIMEOUT=2000    # Milliseconds for DB timeout
SKIP_SSR_QUERIES=true      # Skip all SSR database queries
```

## Deployment Notes
- No database changes required
- Set `DISABLE_AUTH_REFRESH=true` in production
- Monitor `/api/health-check` to identify bottlenecks
- Can be deployed immediately
- Will fix 502 errors for ALL authenticated routes
