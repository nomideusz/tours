# Testing the Early Access Form

The form now handles different scenarios gracefully:

## Test Scenarios

### 1. **New Email Address**
- Enter a new email that doesn't exist in your Resend audience
- **Expected Result**: "✓ Successfully subscribed to early access!"

### 2. **Duplicate Email Address (Active Subscriber)**
- Enter an email that already exists and is subscribed
- **Expected Result**: "✓ You're already signed up for early access! We'll keep you updated."

### 3. **Previously Unsubscribed Email**
- Enter an email that exists but was unsubscribed
- **Expected Result**: "✓ Welcome back! You've been resubscribed to early access updates."

### 4. **Invalid Email Format**
- Enter an invalid email (missing @ symbol)
- **Expected Result**: Red error message: "Valid email is required"

### 5. **Network/Server Error**
- If Resend API is down or misconfigured
- **Expected Result**: Red error message: "Failed to subscribe. Please try again later."

## How to Test

1. Make sure your `.env` file has valid Resend credentials
2. Start the dev server: `pnpm dev`
3. Go to the homepage and try the scenarios above
4. Check your Resend dashboard to see the contacts being managed

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **First**: The API checks if the email already exists in your audience
2. **If exists and subscribed**: Returns friendly "already subscribed" message
3. **If exists but unsubscribed**: Resubscribes them and welcomes them back
4. **If doesn't exist**: Creates new contact and subscribes them
5. **Error handling**: Catches and handles various error cases gracefully

The form provides appropriate feedback for each scenario without exposing technical details to users.
