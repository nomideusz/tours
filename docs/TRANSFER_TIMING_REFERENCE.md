## 💡 **Guide Implications**

### For Cash Flow:

| Policy | Average Hold Time | Best For |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| **Non-Refundable** | 0 hours ⚡ | Special events, tickets |
| **Very Flexible** | 3 hours | Short-notice tours |
| **Flexible** | 1 day | Standard tours |
| **Moderate** | 2 days | Premium experiences |
| **Strict** | 8 days | Long-lead planning |

### Trade-offs:

**Faster Payout (Non-Refundable):**
- ✅ Get money immediately
- ✅ Better cash flow
- ❌ Fewer bookings (customers want refunds)
- ❌ More disputes if issues arise

**Slower Payout (Flexible/Moderate):**
- ✅ More bookings (customer trust)
- ✅ Fewer disputes
- ✅ Professional experience
- ❌ Funds held longer
- ❌ Can't access immediately

---

## 🔄 **Special Cases**

### Past Tours (Completed)
```
Transfer happens: Immediately after tour completion
No waiting period needed!
```

### Same-Day Bookings
```
If customer books WITH cancellation window:
→ Still held for full window
→ Might transfer AFTER tour starts
→ That's OK - tour already happened!
```

### Failed/Cancelled Bookings
```
Never transferred - funds stay on platform for refund
```

## 🎯 **Recommendation**

**Default to "Flexible" (24h) because:**
- ✅ Industry standard
- ✅ Customer trust
- ✅ Higher conversion
- ✅ Reasonable 1-day hold
- ✅ Get paid day before tour

**Use "Non-Refundable" only for:**
- Tickets to events
- Limited capacity experiences
- Non-weather-dependent tours
- When immediate cash flow critical

Most tour guides should use **Flexible** or **Moderate** for best balance! ⭐
