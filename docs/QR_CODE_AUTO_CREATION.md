# Automatic QR Code Creation for Tours

## Overview

As of this update, the Zaur tour booking system now automatically creates a QR code when a new tour is created. This simplifies the tour setup process and ensures every tour has at least one QR code ready for marketing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side Tour Creation (`src/routes/(app)/tours/new/+page.server.ts`)

When a tour is created via server action, the system now:
- Creates the tour as before
- Automatically generates a default QR code with:
  - Name: `[Tour Name] - Main QR Code`
  - Category: `digital` (suitable for social media/online sharing)
  - Standard black & white styling
  - Active status
  - Unique code generated from tour name prefix + random suffix

### 1.5. Client-Side Tour Creation (`src/routes/(app)/tours/new/+page.svelte`)

When a tour is created via client-side API, the system now:
- Creates the tour as before  
- Automatically generates a default QR code with the same specifications as server-side
- Includes proper error handling to ensure tour creation succeeds even if QR creation fails

### 2. User Experience Improvements

#### Schedule Page (`src/routes/(app)/tours/[id]/schedule/+page.svelte`)
- Shows a green notification that a QR code was automatically created
- Updated progress steps to say "Share QR code" instead of "Generate QR codes"

#### Tour Details Page (`src/routes/(app)/tours/[id]/+page.svelte`)
- QR Codes button is highlighted when QR codes exist
- Shows count of codes and "ready to share" message
- Visual emphasis with purple accent when codes are available

#### QR Codes Page (`src/routes/(app)/tours/[id]/qr/+page.svelte`)
- Special welcome message when viewing the auto-created QR code
- Quick actions to copy the booking link or create additional codes
- Explains the purpose of the automatically created code

### 1.6. Tour Duplication (`src/routes/(app)/tours/+page.svelte`)

When a tour is duplicated:
- Creates the new tour with "(Copy)" suffix
- Automatically generates a unique QR code for the duplicated tour
- Ensures each tour copy has its own distinct QR codes

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Readiness**: Tours are immediately shareable after creation
2. **Simplified Workflow**: One less step in the tour setup process
3. **Better Defaults**: Sensible defaults (digital category, standard styling)
4. **Flexibility**: Users can still create additional QR codes for different marketing channels

## QR Code Categories

The default QR code is created with the "digital" category, but users can create additional codes for:
- üì± **Digital/Social**: For online sharing (default)
- üñ®Ô∏è **Print Materials**: For flyers, posters, business cards
- ü§ù **Partner/Referral**: For affiliate or partner programs
- üéâ **Special Events**: For event-specific promotions
- üî• **Limited Offers**: For time-sensitive campaigns

## Technical Details

### QR Code Generation
- Code format: `[TOUR_PREFIX]-[RANDOM]` (e.g., `CIT-A3B5C7`)
- Tour prefix: First 3 letters of tour name (uppercase, letters only)
- Random suffix: 6 character alphanumeric string

### Error Handling
- If QR code creation fails, the tour is still created successfully
- Error is logged but doesn't block the tour creation process
- Users can manually create QR codes later if needed

### Client-Side vs Server-Side Creation
- The system handles both client-side (`toursApi.create()`) and server-side form submissions
- QR codes are created automatically in both flows
- Consistent behavior regardless of which creation method is used

## Troubleshooting

If a QR code is not created automatically:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify user authentication is working properly
3. Ensure PocketBase permissions allow QR code creation
4. QR codes can always be created manually from the tour's QR codes page

## Future Enhancements

Consider these potential improvements:
1. Allow customization of the default QR code settings
2. Add tour category-based QR code templates
3. Bulk QR code generation for different marketing channels
4. QR code analytics dashboard
