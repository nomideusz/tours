# Advanced Group Pricing & Add-ons - Executive Summary

## The Opportunity

A tour guide reached out with a critical pain point that affects **every private tour operator on our platform**:

> *"I need different prices for different group sizes. Price per person is too expensive for large groups, but a fixed group price is too expensive for solo travelers. I also need to show transport costs separately so I'm not paying commission on fuel and parking."*

This is **the** pricing problem for indie tour guides running private tours with vehicles.

---

## The Solution

**Flexible Group-Based Pricing + Optional Add-ons**

### What We'll Build

1. **Group Size Tiers** - Price based on total participants
   - Example: 1-2 people = ‚Ç¨150, 3-4 = ‚Ç¨250, 5-8 = ‚Ç¨400
   - Unlimited custom tiers
   - Visual tier selector for customers

2. **Optional Add-ons** - Separate pricing for extras
   - Transport, accommodation, meals, photos, etc.
   - Required or optional
   - Transparent cost breakdown
   - **No commission on add-ons** (Zaur advantage!)

### Why This Matters

‚úÖ **Solves real pain** - Direct feedback from target market
‚úÖ **Competitive advantage** - No other platform offers this flexibility
‚úÖ **Indie guide friendly** - Built for small operators, not agencies
‚úÖ **Highlights Zaur USP** - Transparent pricing + no commission = guide keeps 100%
‚úÖ **Increases conversions** - Fair pricing for all group sizes

## Business Case

### Revenue Potential

**Current State:**
- Tour guides create 2-3 separate tours for different group sizes
- Confusing for customers
- Lower conversion rates
- Missed bookings (pricing doesn't fit)

**With Group Pricing:**
- 1 tour reaches all group sizes
- Higher conversion (fair pricing)
- Increased average booking value (add-ons)
- Better guide retention

**Conservative Estimate:**
- 30% of tour guides adopt group pricing (private tour operators)
- 15% increase in conversions due to fair pricing
- 25% increase in average booking value (add-ons)
- **Net Impact: ~40% revenue increase for guides using the feature**

### Investment Required

**Development:** 4-6 weeks (1 full-time developer)
**Design:** 1-2 weeks (UI/UX designer)
**QA/Testing:** 1 week
**Documentation:** 3-5 days

**Total:** ~8 weeks to production-ready feature

## Competitive Analysis

### Current Market
- **GetYourGuide:** Fixed per-person pricing only
- **Viator:** Fixed per-person or fixed group (no tiers)
- **Airbnb Experiences:** Per-person only
- **ToursByLocals:** Per-group or per-person (no flexibility)

### Zaur Advantage

| Feature | Zaur | Competitors |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Group size tiers | ‚úÖ Unlimited custom | ‚ùå None |
| Optional add-ons | ‚úÖ Separate pricing | ‚ùå None |
| Transparent breakdown | ‚úÖ Base + extras | ‚ùå Total only |
| Commission on add-ons | ‚úÖ 0% | ‚ùå 15-20% |
| Pricing flexibility | ‚úÖ 4 models | ‚ùå 1-2 models |

**Result:** Zaur becomes the **only** platform truly built for private tour economics.
