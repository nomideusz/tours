# CapRover Build Cache Configuration
# This file helps CapRover understand caching strategy

# Enable build cache in CapRover:
# 1. Go to CapRover Dashboard
# 2. Select your app (zaur)
# 3. Go to "Deployment" tab
# 4. Enable "Use Build Cache" option
# 5. This will cache Docker layers between builds

# Expected speed improvements:
# - First build: ~3-5 minutes (full build)
# - Subsequent builds (code changes only): ~30-60 seconds
# - Dependency changes: ~2-3 minutes

# What gets cached:
# ✓ node_modules (if package.json unchanged)
# ✓ pnpm store
# ✓ Base images
# ✓ System dependencies

# What gets rebuilt:
# ✗ Your source code (src/)
# ✗ Build output (build/)
# ✗ Only changed files
