# Admin Beta User Creation Guide

## Overview
The admin panel now supports automatic application of the BETA_APPRECIATION promo code when creating beta tester accounts. This streamlines the process of setting up beta users with their special benefits.

## How to Create Beta Tester Accounts

### Step 1: Access Admin Panel
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to `/admin` 
3. Click the "Create User" button

### Step 2: Fill User Details
1. **Email Address**: Enter the beta tester's email
2. **Full Name**: Enter their full name
3. **Password**: Use a professional temporary password format:
   - Recommended: `BetaZaur2025!` + 4 random digits
   - Example: `BetaZaur2025!7392`
4. **Role**: Select "User (Tour Guide)" (unless they need admin access)
5. **âœ… Beta Tester Account**: Check this checkbox

### Step 3: Automatic Benefits Application
When you check the "Beta Tester Account" checkbox, the system will:
- Automatically apply the BETA_APPRECIATION promo code
- Give the user 12 months free trial
- Set up 30% lifetime discount after the trial
- Show confirmation in the success message

### Step 4: Success Confirmation
After creation, you'll see a message like:
```
User account created successfully for john@example.com. 
Beta benefits applied: 12 months free + 30% lifetime discount.
```

## Technical Details

### Database Requirements
Before creating beta users, ensure the BETA_APPRECIATION promo code exists:

```sql
-- Run this SQL in your database first
UPDATE promo_codes 
SET 
  description = 'Beta user appreciation - 30% lifetime discount + 12 months free',
  type = 'early_access',
  discount_percentage = 30,
  free_months = 12,
  is_lifetime = true,
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'cc15b7db-63d5-45cc-ab93-f4f5ac4ac2f9';
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes
1. User account is created with `emailVerified: true`
2. System checks if "Beta Tester" checkbox was selected
3. If yes, system looks up BETA_APPRECIATION promo code
4. `applyPromoCodeToUser()` function is called
5. User profile is updated with:
   - `promoCodeUsed`: 'BETA_APPRECIATION'
   - `subscriptionFreeUntil`: [12 months from now]
   - `subscriptionDiscountPercentage`: 30
   - `isLifetimeDiscount`: true
   - `earlyAccessMember`: true

### Error Handling
If the promo code application fails, the user account is still created, but you'll see a note in the success message:
- `(Note: Beta promo code not found - please apply manually)`
- `(Note: Beta promo code could not be applied automatically)`

In these cases, you can manually apply the promo code through the regular promo code system.

## Password Recommendations

### Option 1: Branded Temporary Passwords (Recommended)
- Format: `BetaZaur2025!` + 4 random digits
- Examples: `BetaZaur2025!7392`, `BetaZaur2025!8156`
- Professional, secure, easy to communicate

### Option 2: Personalized Passwords
- Format: `[FirstName]Beta2025!`
- Examples: `JohnBeta2025!`, `SarahBeta2025!`
- Personal touch, memorable

### Option 3: Random Secure Passwords
- 12+ characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols
- Maximum security but harder to communicate

## Verification Checklist

After creating a beta user account:
- [ ] User account created successfully
- [ ] Beta benefits confirmation message appeared
- [ ] Email sent to beta tester with credentials
- [ ] User can log in with temporary password
- [ ] User sees beta benefits in their subscription page
- [ ] Pricing shows "FREE during trial" for 12 months
- [ ] After trial, pricing shows 30% discount

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Beta promo code not found"
**Solution**: Run the SQL script to create the BETA_APPRECIATION promo code

### Issue: "Beta promo code could not be applied"
**Solution**: Check server logs for specific error, or apply manually via promo code system

### Issue: User doesn't see beta benefits
**Solution**: Check user's profile in admin panel for promo code fields

### Issue: Pricing not showing correctly
**Solution**: Verify `subscriptionFreeUntil` and `subscriptionDiscountPercentage` fields

## Benefits Summary

Beta testers get:
1. **Immediate**: 12 months completely free (â‚¬0/month)
2. **After trial**: 30% lifetime discount (â‚¬20.30 instead of â‚¬29 for Professional)
3. **Forever**: Discount never expires, even if they cancel and resubscribe
4. **Early access**: First to see new features and updates

This creates a win-win: beta testers get exceptional value, and Zaur gets committed early adopters who help shape the product.
