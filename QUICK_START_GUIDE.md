# Quick Start Guide - Google Maps & Weather Integration

## üéâ What's New

Your Zaur tour platform now has:
- ‚úÖ **Google Maps** for precise location selection
- ‚úÖ **Weather Integration** with real-time conditions and forecasts
- ‚úÖ **Weather Advisories** for tour guides
- ‚úÖ **Professional map interface** for customers

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Google Maps API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create/select a project
3. Enable these APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
4. Create API key
5. Restrict it to your domain
6. **Free:** $200/month credit (more than enough for most tour businesses)

### Step 2: Enable Google Weather API (Recommended)

**Good news!** Google now has a Weather API in pilot program (FREE)!

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project (same as Google Maps)
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Library**
4. Search for **"Weather API"**
5. Click **Enable**
6. Your existing Google Maps API key will work!

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ FREE during pilot
- ‚úÖ 10-day forecast (vs 5-day others)
- ‚úÖ Same key as Google Maps
- ‚úÖ More comprehensive data

### Step 2b: Get OpenWeatherMap Key (Optional Backup)

For maximum reliability, also get OpenWeatherMap:

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up (free account)
3. Copy your API key from dashboard
4. Wait ~10 minutes for activation
5. **Free:** 1,000 calls/day

**This is optional but recommended** - your system will automatically fall back to OpenWeather if Google Weather has any issues.

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# ============================================
# GOOGLE MAPS & WEATHER (Recommended Setup)
# ============================================

# For maps display & Google Weather (PUBLIC = visible to browser)
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key_here

# For geocoding/search (server-side, more secure)  
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key_here

# ============================================
# WEATHER FALLBACK (Optional but Recommended)
# ============================================

# OpenWeatherMap as backup (optional but recommended)
PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key_here
```

**What This Does:**
- ‚úÖ **Google Maps** for location selection
- ‚úÖ **Google Weather** for weather data (10-day forecast, FREE)
- ‚úÖ **OpenWeatherMap** as fallback if Google fails
- ‚úÖ Maximum reliability with dual providers

**Quick Setup (Development):**
Use the same Google Maps key for both PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY and GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY.

**Secure Setup (Production):**
- PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: HTTP referrer restrictions
- GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: IP restrictions

### Step 4: Deploy

Deploy your application with the new environment variables.

**CapRover:**
- Go to App Configs ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Add both variables
- Restart app

**Other Platforms:**
- Add variables in your platform's environment settings
- Redeploy
