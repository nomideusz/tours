# Layout Separation Implementation

## Overview

The application has been successfully separated into two distinct layout groups to provide better user experiences for different user types:

1. **Public Layout** - For marketing pages and customer interactions
2. **App Layout** - For authenticated tour guide dashboard

## New Structure

```
src/routes/
â”œâ”€â”€ +layout.svelte (minimal root layout)
â”œâ”€â”€ +layout.server.ts (minimal processing)
â”œâ”€â”€ (public)/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ +layout.svelte (marketing layout with header/footer)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ +page.svelte (landing page)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/ (login, register, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ book/ (booking flow for customers)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ticket/ (ticket viewing for customers)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ checkin/ (customer check-in)
â””â”€â”€ (app)/
    â”œâ”€â”€ +layout.svelte (dashboard with sidebar)
    â”œâ”€â”€ +layout.server.ts (auth enforcement)
    â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/ (overview page)
    â”œâ”€â”€ tours/ (tour management)
    â”œâ”€â”€ bookings/ (booking management)
    â”œâ”€â”€ profile/ (user settings)
    â”œâ”€â”€ checkin-scanner/ (QR scanner for guides)
    â””â”€â”€ admin/ (admin functions)
```
