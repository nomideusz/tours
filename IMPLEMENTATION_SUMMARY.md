## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Map Service Abstraction
The map integration uses a clean abstraction layer that supports multiple providers:
- Google Maps (default)
- OpenStreetMap (fallback)
- Mapbox (optional)

This makes it easy to switch providers or use multiple providers.

### Weather Service
- Modular design with clear interfaces
- Server-side API endpoints for security
- Client-side components for real-time updates
- Automatic caching recommendations (10-minute cache)
- Rate limiting considerations documented

### Component Design
- Reusable, self-contained components
- Props-based configuration
- Error handling built-in
- Loading states
- Fallback UI when APIs unavailable

## üîß Required Setup

### 1. Google Maps API Key

**Get it from:** [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

**Required APIs:**
- Maps JavaScript API
- Places API
- Geocoding API

**Cost:** ~$5-90/month depending on usage (free $200 credit available)

**Add to environment:**
```bash
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 2. OpenWeatherMap API Key

**Get it from:** [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

**Plan:** Free tier (1,000 calls/day) is sufficient for most tour businesses

**Cost:** Free for basic usage

**Add to environment:**
```bash
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
